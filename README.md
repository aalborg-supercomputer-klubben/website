# Aalborg Supercomputer Club website

This repository hosts our work-in-progress website. It is built using Astro and TypeScript, with a theme inspired by [Spectre](https://spectre.lou.gg/) by [Louis Escher](https://lou.gg/).

## Development

Node.js must be installed.

To view the site during development with automatic reload:
```
npm run dev
```

To build the site:
```
npm run build
```

The output will be in `dist`.

To preview the site after building:
```
npm run preview
```
